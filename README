Iglu is an atomic framework, written in Java. It's a reference implementation for research focused
on the configuration of an application in terms of modules, clusters, layers and their relations.
It helps developers organize high-level separation of concerns and adhere to application design.

Iglu Util contains utilities to support runtime environment features provided in Iglu Common.
Iglu Util keeps Iglu independent of other 3rd party libraries.

Iglu is developed and maintained by Jeroen Meetsma, partner at IJsberg.
