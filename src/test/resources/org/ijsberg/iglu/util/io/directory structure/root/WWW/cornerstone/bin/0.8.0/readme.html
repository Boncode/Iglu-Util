Cornerstone Version 0.8.x
oct 19 2003

ABOUT

This package contains a beta release of the Cornerstone Application Server.
Cornerstone is a lightweight component framework aimed at easy component
based development, deployment, maintenance and integration. Cornerstone
is meant for educational purposes as well as demanding production
environments.

In this package Cornerstone is merely used to create a simple wrapper for
the Jetty Web Server & Servlet Container, thus providing you with a
ready-to-go Java web environment.

A basic 1.0 version of Cornerstone is currently under construction and is
due early 2004. We hope to provide you with documentation and examples
sooner in another beta release. More information is available (in Dutch) on:
http://www.ijsberg.nl/cornerstone.

USAGE

You need Java 1.2, 1.3 or 1.4 to run the code. A suitable Java Runtime
Enviroment (JRE) or Development Kit (SDK) should be available on one of the
following URL's:
http://java.sun.com/jdk/1.2/download.html
http://java.sun.com/jdk/1.3/download.html
http://java.sun.com/jdk/1.4/download.html

NOTE: If you are using jdk 1.4, you have to modify startcs.bat or startcs.sh.
An instruction for the modification is included in startcs.

Start the webserver using startcs.bat in a Windows or DOS operating system or
startcs.sh on a Unix like system. The webserver runs standard on port 80. An
application control device can be found on port 9090. Settings can be altered
in conf/app.ini.
